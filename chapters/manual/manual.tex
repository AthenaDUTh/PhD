\subsection{Finetuning the backref package}

Finetuning the backref package (when \textbf{not} using biblatex). Add the
following to your preamble:

\begin{verbatim}
% See [http://n2.nabble.com/backref-td478438.html]:
% simple backref command redefinition to avoid double entries
\makeatletter
\ifadsphd@biblatex\else
  \ifadsphd@pagebackref%
    \renewcommand*{\backref}[1]{}
    % redefinition of the actually used \backrefalt 
    \renewcommand*{\backrefalt}[4]{% 
    \ifcase #1 % 
       % case: not cited 
    \or 
       % case: cited on exactly one page 
       Cited on page~#2.
    \else 
       % case: cited on multiple pages 
       Cited on pages~#2.
    \fi}
  \else
    \renewcommand*{\backref}[1]{}
    % redefinition of the actually used \backrefalt 
    \renewcommand*{\backrefalt}[4]{% 
    \ifcase #1 % 
       % case: not cited 
    \or 
       % case: cited on exactly one page 
       Cited in Section~#2.
    \else 
       % case: cited on multiple pages 
       Cited in Sections~#2.
    \fi}
  \fi
\fi
\makeatother
\end{verbatim}
