\chapter{Resume}\label{ch:curriculum}

Athina Papadopoulou was born and raised in Greece. In 2021, she received the Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus in electronics and information systems from the Democritus University of Thrace. Between 2019 and 2020, she joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Switzerland, as a technical student, to work on the experimental evaluation of the sensitivity of commercial power MOSFETs to ionizing radiation. This work was summarized in her master thesis. Between 2021 and 2024, she has been pursuing her PhD degree in Engineering Technology at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. Jan Genoe. Her research focused on the study of thermally evaporated inorganic perovskite thin films, and their integration in all-inorganic, vacuum-deposited photodiodes, targeting ultra-high resolution imaging applications.
