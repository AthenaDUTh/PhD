Athina Papadopoulou was born and raised in Ptolemaida, Greece. In 2021, she received the Diploma degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with a focus in electronics and information systems. Between 2019 and 2020, she joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Switzerland, as a technical student, to work on the experimental evaluation of the sensitivity of commercial power MOSFETs to ionizing radiation. This work was summarized in her master thesis. Between 2021 and 2024, she has been pursuing her PhD degree in Engineering Technology at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. Jan Genoe. Her research focused on the utilization and optimization of vacuum-deposited, all-inorganic photodiodes for ultra-high resolution imaging applications under the project "Gigapixel", funded by the Flemish government.
