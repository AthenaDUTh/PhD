\chapter{Fabrication and Characterization}\label{ch:appendixA}


\textbf{Perovskite Deposition}

\textbf{Device Fabrication}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Glass-ITO
    \item PIX Substrates 
    \item MOS Cap
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Material Characterization}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item GIWAXS
    \item AFM, Profilometer, SEM, Reflectance/Transmittance, SSPL and TRPL, Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
\end{enumerate}

The nominal thickness for each prcursor was the thickness depsited during the co-evpaoration for a nominal 1.05:1.00 CsBr to \ch{PbI_2} molar ratio, hence a nominal thickness of 164 nm for \ch{PbI_2}and 112 nm of CsBr. The thickness variation of each precursor across the whole wafer was scanned using single-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measuremetns of 50 points across the whole wafer.

\textbf{Device Characterization}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item JV in Dark and 1-sun illumination
    \item Spectral Response 
    \item PAIOS for transient and capacitance measurements 
    \item Transmission Electron Microscopy 
\end{enumerate}
